Hello
My name is Wendell White and I am a Bitcoin Analyst and Trading Researcher using RStudio (and sometimes Python). I love learning about Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, the statistical programming language R, and old school Martial Arts movies.

I hav BSc and ME degrees in Petroleum Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines and have worked all over the world on a variety of complex drilling projects. During the oil and gas downturn I discovered the world of Bitcoin and have been fascinated by it ever since. You can find me on Twitter and GitHub.

I live in the Mile High City of Denver, CO.
